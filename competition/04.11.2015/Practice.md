##Coding Practice 1

Rules  
1. It is important to solve the challenge without referring to existing solutions. Don't search for solutions online.  
2. Submit a working, buildable solution with test cases in 1 single file (each question maps to a different method or group of methods). Include test cases in your solution: e.g. 0, -1, min/max,
overflow, etc.  
3. Write clear, good documentation in your code.  
4. Be aware of differences between HashTable vs HashMap vs HashSet, or Array vs ArrayList, and other 'similarly'-named data structures. Understand what problems these structures are suitable for. Be familiar with how 1 data structure can be converted to another, if the programming language supports it natively, use it.  
5. Use existing data structures supported by the language, unless the problem is 'implement a hash table'.  
6. After solving the problem, think about space/time complexity and improve the solution.  
7. This is a coding practice. We do not provide solutions or feedback after your submission.  

##Questions
1. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.  
2. Given a sorted (in increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.  
3. Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = {
S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t
matter.  

For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So
output should be 4.
